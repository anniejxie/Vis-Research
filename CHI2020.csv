,Title,Award,Link,Year,Authors,Abstract0,Evaluating Multivariate Network Visualization Techniques Using a Validated Design and Crowdsourcing Approach,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376381,2020,"['Carolina  Nobre', 'Dylan  Wootton', 'Lane  Harrison', 'Alexander  Lex']","Visualizing multivariate networks is challenging because of the trade-offs necessary for effectively encoding network topology and encoding the attributes associated with nodes and edges. A large number of multivariate network visualization techniques exist, yet there is little empirical guidance on their respective strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we describe a crowdsourced experiment, comparing node-link diagrams with on-node encoding and adjacency matrices with juxtaposed tables. We find that node-link diagrams are best suited for tasks that require close integration between the network topology and a few attributes. Adjacency matrices perform well for tasks related to clusters and when many attributes need to be considered. We also reflect on our method of using validated designs for empirically evaluating complex, interactive visualizations in a crowdsourced setting. We highlight the importance of training, compensation, and provenance tracking."1,Towards an Understanding of Augmented Reality Extensions for Existing 3D Data Analysis Tools,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376657,2020,"['Xiyao  Wang', 'Lonni  Besançon', 'David  Rousseau', 'Mickael  Sereno', 'Mehdi  Ammi', 'Tobias  Isenberg']","We present an observational study with domain experts to understand how augmented reality (AR) extensions to traditional PC-based data analysis tools can help particle physicists to explore and understand 3D data. Our goal is to allow researchers to integrate stereoscopic AR-based visual representations and interaction techniques into their tools, and thus ultimately to increase the adoption of modern immersive analytics techniques in existing data analysis workflows. We use Microsoft's HoloLens as a lightweight and easily maintainable AR headset and replicate existing visualization and interaction capabilities on both the PC and the AR view. We treat the AR headset as a second yet stereoscopic screen, allowing researchers to study their data in a connected multi-view manner. Our results indicate that our collaborating physicists appreciate a hybrid data exploration setup with an interactive AR extension to improve their understanding of particle collision events."2,Evaluation of a Financial Portfolio Visualization using Computer Displays and Mixed Reality Devices with Domain Experts,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376556,2020,"['Kay  Schroeder', 'Batoul  Ajdadilish', 'Alexander P. Henkel', 'André  Calero Valdez']","With the advent of mixed reality devices such as the Microsoft HoloLens, developers have been faced with the challenge to utilize the third dimension in information visualization effectively. Research on stereoscopic devices has shown that three-dimensional representation can improve accuracy in specific tasks (e.g., network visualization). Yet, so far the field has remained mute on the underlying mechanism. Our study systematically investigates the differences in user perception between a regular monitor and a mixed reality device. In a real-life within-subject experiment in the field with twenty-eight investment bankers, we assessed subjective and objective task performance with two- and three-dimensional systems, respectively. We tested accuracy with regard to position, size, and color using single and combined tasks. Our results do not show a significant difference in accuracy between mixed-reality and standard 2D monitor visualizations."3,Decipher: An Interactive Visualization Tool for Interpreting Unstructured Design Feedback from Multiple Providers,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376380,2020,"['Yu-Chun Grace Yen', 'Joy O. Kim', 'Brian P. Bailey']","Feedback from diverse audiences can vary in focus, differ in structure, and contradict each other, making it hard to interpret and act on. While prior work has explored generating quality feedback, our work helps a designer interpret that feedback. Through a formative study with professional designers (N=10), we discovered that the interpretation process includes categorizing feedback, identifying valuable feedback, and prioritizing which feedback to incorporate in a revision. We also found that designers leverage feedback topic and sentiment, and the status of the provider to aid interpretation. Based on the findings, we created a new tool (Decipher) that enables designers to visualize and navigate a collection of feedback using its topic and sentiment structure. In a preliminary evaluation (N=20), we found that Decipher helped users feel less overwhelmed during feedback interpretation tasks and better attend to critical issues and conflicting opinions compared to using a typical document-editing tool."4,Watch+Strap: Extending Smartwatches with Interactive StrapDisplays,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376199,2020,"['Konstantin  Klamka', 'Tom  Horak', 'Raimund  Dachselt']","While smartwatches are widely adopted these days, their input and output space remains fairly limited by their screen size. We present StrapDisplays—interactive watchbands with embedded display and touch technologies—that enhance commodity watches and extend their input and output capabilities. After introducing the physical design space of these StrapDisplays, we explore how to combine a smartwatch and straps in a synergistic Watch+Strap system. Specifically, we propose multiple interface concepts that consider promising content distributions, interaction techniques, usage types, and display roles. For example, the straps can enrich watch apps, display visualizations, provide glanceable feedback, or help avoiding occlusion issues. Further, we provide a modular research platform incorporating three StrapDisplay prototypes and a flexible web-based software architecture, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. Early brainstorming sessions with 15 participants informed our design process, while later interviews with six experts supported our concepts and provided valuable feedback for future developments."5,Techniques for Flexible Responsive Visualization Design,BEST_PAPER,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376777,2020,"['Jane  Hoffswell', 'Wilmot  Li', 'Zhicheng  Liu']","Responsive visualizations adapt to effectively present information based on the device context. Such adaptations are essential for news content that is increasingly consumed on mobile devices. However, existing tools provide little support for responsive visualization design. We analyze a corpus of 231 responsive news visualizations and discuss formative interviews with five journalists about responsive visualization design. These interviews motivate four central design guidelines: enable simultaneous cross-device edits, facilitate device-specific customization, show cross-device previews, and support propagation of edits. Based on these guidelines, we present a prototype system that allows users to preview and edit multiple visualization versions simultaneously. We demonstrate the utility of the system features by recreating four real-world responsive visualizations from our corpus."6,Interpreting Interpretability: Understanding Data Scientists' Use of Interpretability Tools for Machine Learning,HONORABLE_MENTION,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376219,2020,"['Harmanpreet  Kaur', 'Harsha  Nori', 'Samuel  Jenkins', 'Rich  Caruana', 'Hanna  Wallach', 'Jennifer  Wortman Vaughan']","Machine learning (ML) models are now routinely deployed in domains ranging from criminal justice to healthcare. With this newfound ubiquity, ML has moved beyond academia and grown into an engineering discipline. To that end, interpretability tools have been designed to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners better understand how ML models work. However, there has been little evaluation of the extent to which these tools achieve this goal. We study data scientists' use of two existing interpretability tools, the InterpretML implementation of GAMs and the SHAP Python package. We conduct a contextual inquiry (N=11) and a survey (N=197) of data scientists to observe how they use interpretability tools to uncover common issues that arise when building and evaluating ML models. Our results indicate that data scientists over-trust and misuse interpretability tools. Furthermore, few of our participants were able to accurately describe the visualizations output by these tools. We highlight qualitative themes for data scientists' mental models of interpretability tools. We conclude with implications for researchers and tool designers, and contextualize our findings in the social science literature."7,MRAT: The Mixed Reality Analytics Toolkit,BEST_PAPER,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376330,2020,"['Michael  Nebeling', 'Maximilian  Speicher', 'Xizi  Wang', 'Shwetha  Rajaram', 'Brian D.

We elicit requirements for future tools through interviews with 8 university research, instructional, and media teams using AR/VR in a variety of domains. While we find a common need for capturing how users perform tasks in MR, the primary differences were in terms of heuristics and metrics relevant to each project. Particularly in the early project stages, teams were uncertain about what data should, and even could, be collected with MR technologies. We designed the Mixed Reality Analytics Toolkit (MRAT) to instrument MR apps via visual editors without programming and enable rapid data collection and filtering for visualizations of MR user sessions. With MRAT, we contribute flexible interaction tracking and task definition concepts, an extensible set of heuristic techniques and metrics to measure task success, and visual inspection tools with in-situ visualizations in MR. Focusing on a multi-user, cross-device MR crisis simulation and triage training app as a case study, we then show the benefits of using MRAT, not only for user testing of MR apps, but also performance tuning throughout the design process."8,Pushing the (Visual) Narrative: The Effects of Prior Knowledge Elicitation in Provocative Topics,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376887,2020,"['Jeremy  Heyer', 'Nirmal Kumar  Raveendranath', 'Khairi  Reda']","Narrative visualization is a popular style of data-driven storytelling. Authors use this medium to engage viewers with complex and sometimes controversial issues. A challenge for authors is to not only deliver new information, but to also overcome people's biases and misconceptions. We study how people adjust their attitudes toward (or away from) a message experienced through a narrative visualization. In a mixed-methods analysis, we investigate whether eliciting participants' prior beliefs, and visualizing those beliefs alongside actual data, can increase narrative persuasiveness. We find that incorporating priors does not significantly affect attitudinal change. However, participants who externalized their beliefs expressed greater surprise at the data. Their comments also indicated a greater likelihood of acquiring new information, despite the minimal change in attitude. Our results also extend prior findings, showing that visualizations are more persuasive than equivalent textual data representations for exposing contentious issues. We discuss the implications and outline future research directions."9,Prior Setting in Practice: Strategies and Rationales Used in Choosing Prior Distributions for Bayesian Analysis,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376377,2020,"['Abhraneel  Sarma', 'Matthew  Kay']","Bayesian statistical analysis is steadily growing in popularity and use. Choosing priors is an integral part of Bayesian inference. While there exist extensive normative recommendations for prior setting, little is known about how priors are chosen in practice. We conducted a survey (N = 50) and interviews (N = 9) where we used interactive visualizations to elicit prior distributions from researchers experienced withBayesian statistics and asked them for rationales for those priors. We found that participants' experience and philosophy influence how much and what information they are willing to incorporate into their priors, manifesting as different levels of informativeness and skepticism. We also identified three broad strategies participants use to set their priors: centrality matching, interval matching, and visual mass allocation. We discovered that participants' understanding of the notion of""weakly informative priors""—a commonly-recommended normative approach to prior setting—manifests very differently across participants. Our results have implications both for how to develop prior setting recommendations and how to design tools to elicit priors in Bayesian analysis."10,Assessing 2D and 3D Heatmaps for Comparative Analysis: An Empirical Study,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376675,2020,"['Matthias  Kraus', 'Katrin  Angerbauer', 'Juri  Buchmüller', 'Daniel  Schweitzer', 'Daniel A. Keim', 'Michael  Sedlmair', 'Johannes  Fuchs']","Heatmaps are a popular visualization technique that encode 2D density distributions using color or brightness. Experimental studies have shown though that both of these visual variables are inaccurate when reading and comparing numeric data values. A potential remedy might be to use 3D heatmaps by introducing height as a third dimension to encode the data. Encoding abstract data in 3D, however, poses many problems, too. To better understand this tradeoff, we conducted an empirical study (N=48) to evaluate the user performance of 2D and 3D heatmaps for comparative analysis tasks. We test our conditions on a conventional 2D screen, but also in a virtual reality environment to allow for real stereoscopic vision. Our main results show that 3D heatmaps are superior in terms of error rate when reading and comparing single data items. However, for overview tasks, the well-established 2D heatmap performs better."11,Projection Boxes: On-the-fly Reconfigurable Visualization for Live Programming,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376494,2020,['Sorin  Lerner'],"Live programming is a regime in which the programming environment provides continual feedback, most often in the form of runtime values. In this paper, we present Projection Boxes, a novel visualization technique for displaying runtime values of programs. The key idea behind projection boxes is to start with a full semantics of the program, and then use projections to pick a subset of the semantics to display. By varying the projection used, projection boxes can encode both previously known visualization techniques, and also new ones. As such, projection boxes provide an expressive and configurable framework for displaying runtime information. Through a user study we demonstrate that (1) users find projection boxes and their configurability useful (2) users are not distracted by the always-on visualization (3) a key driving force behind the need for a configurable visualization for live programming lies with the wide variation in programmer preferences."12,COGAM: Measuring and Moderating Cognitive Load in Machine Learning Model Explanations,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376615,2020,"['Ashraf  Abdul', 'Christian  von der Weth', 'Mohan  Kankanhalli', 'Brian Y. Lim']","Interpretable machine learning models trade -off accuracy for simplicity to make explanations more readable and easier to comprehend. Drawing from cognitive psychology theories in graph comprehension, we formalize readability as visual cognitive chunks to measure and moderate the cognitive load in explanation visualizations. We present Cognitive-GAM (COGAM) to generate explanations with desired cognitive load and accuracy by combining the expressive nonlinear generalized additive models (GAM) with simpler sparse linear models. We calibrated visual cognitive chunks with reading time in a user study, characterized the trade-off between cognitive load and accuracy for four datasets in simulation studies, and evaluated COGAM against baselines with users. We found that COGAM can decrease cognitive load without decreasing accuracy and/or increase accuracy without increasing cognitive load. Our framework and empirical measurement instruments for cognitive load will enable more rigorous assessment of the human interpretability of explainable AI."13,"Awareness, Understanding, and Action: A Conceptual Framework of User Experiences and Expectations about Indoor Air Quality Visualizations",,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376521,2020,"['Sunyoung  Kim', 'Muyang  Li']","With the advent of new sensors and technologies, smart devices that monitor the level of indoor air quality (IAQ) are increasingly available to create a healthy home environment. However, little has been studied regarding design principles for effective IAQ visualizations to help better understand and improve IAQ. We analyzed Amazon reviews of IAQ monitors and their design components for IAQ visualizations. Based on our findings, we created a conceptual framework to explain the process of facilitating an effective IAQ visualization with a proposed set of design considerations in each stage. The process includes helping users easily understand what is happing to IAQ (awareness), what it means to them (understanding), and what to do with the information (action), which results in two outcomes, knowledge gain and emotional relief. We hope our framework can help practitioners and researchers in designing eco-feedback system and beyond to advance both research and practice."14,Dear Pictograph: Investigating the Role of Personalization and Immersion for Consuming and Enjoying Visualizations,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376348,2020,"['Hugo  Romat', 'Nathalie  Henry Riche', 'Christophe  Hurter', 'Steven  Drucker', 'Fereshteh  Amini', 'Ken  Hinckley']","Much of the visualization literature focuses on assessment of visual representations with regard to their effectiveness for understanding data. In the present work, we instead focus on making data visualization experiences more enjoyable, to foster deeper engagement with data. We investigate two strategies to make visualization experiences more enjoyable and engaging: personalization, and immersion. We selected pictographs (composed of multiple data glyphs) as this representation affords creative freedom, allowing people to craft symbolic or whimsical shapes of personal significance to represent data. We present the results of a qualitative study with 12 participants crafting pictographs using a large pen-enabled device and while immersed within a VR environment. Our results indicate that personalization and immersion both have positive impact on making visualizations more enjoyable experiences."15,Truncating the Y-Axis: Threat or Menace?,HONORABLE_MENTION,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376222,2020,"['Michael  Correll', 'Enrico  Bertini', 'Steven  Franconeri']","Bar charts with y-axes that don't begin at zero can visually exaggerate effect sizes. However, advice for whether or not to truncate the y-axis can be equivocal for other visualization types. In this paper we present examples of visualizations where this y-axis truncation can be beneficial as well as harmful, depending on the communicative and analytic intent. We also present the results of a series of crowd-sourced experiments in which we examine how y-axis truncation impacts subjective effect size across visualization types, and we explore alternative designs that more directly alert viewers to this truncation. We find that the subjective impact of axis truncation is persistent across visualizations designs, even for designs with explicit visual cues that indicate truncation has taken place. We suggest that designers consider the scale of the meaningful effect sizes and variation they intend to communicate, regardless of the visual encoding."16,Progression Maps: Conceptualizing Narrative Structure for Interaction Design Support,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376527,2020,"['Elin  Carstensdottir', 'Nathan  Partlan', 'Steven  Sutherland', 'Tyler  Duke', 'Erika  Ferris', 'Robin M. Richter', 'Maria  Valladares', 'Magy  Seif El-Nasr']","Interactive narratives are frequently designed for learning and training applications, such as social training. In these contexts, designers may be inexperienced in storytelling and interaction design, and it may be difficult to quickly build an effective experience, even for experienced designers. Designers often approach this problem through iterative design. To augment and reduce iteration, we argue for the utility of employing models to reason about, evaluate, and improve designs. While there has been much previous work on interactive narrative models, none of them capture aspects of the interaction design necessary for testing and evaluation. In this paper we propose a new computational model called Progression Maps, which abstracts interaction design elements of the narrative's structure and visualizes its interaction properties. We report on the model, its implementation, and two studies evaluating its use. Our results demonstrate Progression Maps' effectiveness in communicating the underlying design through an easily understandable visualization."17,A Comparison of Geographical Propagation Visualizations,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376350,2020,"['Vanessa  Peña-Araya', 'Anastasia  Bezerianos', 'Emmanuel  Pietriga']","Geographical propagation phenomena occur in multiple domains, such as in epidemiology and social media. Propagation dynamics are often complex, and visualizations play a key role in helping subject-matter experts understand and analyze them. However, there is little empirical data about the effectiveness of the various strategies used to visualize geographical propagation. To fill this gap, we conduct an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of three strategies: an animated map, small-multiple maps, and a single map with glyphs. We compare them under five tasks that vary in one of the following dimensions: propagation scope, direction, speed, peaks, and spatial jumps. Our results show that small-multiple maps perform best overall, but that the effectiveness of each visualization varies depending on the task considered."18,Du Bois Wrapped Bar Chart: Visualizing Categorical Data with Disproportionate Values,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376365,2020,"['Alireza  Karduni', 'Ryan  Wesslen', 'Isaac  Cho', 'Wenwen  Dou']","We propose a visualization technique, Du Bois wrapped bar chart, inspired by work of W.E.B Du Bois. Du Bois wrapped bar charts enable better large-to-small bar comparison by wrapping large bars over a certain threshold. We first present two crowdsourcing experiments comparing wrapped and standard bar charts to evaluate (1) the benefit of wrapped bars in helping participants identify and compare values; (2) the characteristics of data most suitable for wrapped bars. In the first study (n=98) using real-world datasets, we find that wrapped bar charts lead to higher accuracy in identifying and estimating ratios between bars. In a follow-up study (n=190) with 13 simulated datasets, we find participants were consistently more accurate with wrapped bar charts when certain category values are disproportionate as measured by entropy and H-spread. Finally, in an in-lab study, we investigate participants' experience and strategies, leading to guidelines for when and how to use wrapped bar charts."19,Investigating Collaborative Exploration of Design Alternatives on a Wall-Sized Display,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376736,2020,"['Yujiro  Okuya', 'Olivier  Gladin', 'Nicolas  Ladevèze', 'Cédric  Fleury', 'Patrick  Bourdot']","Industrial design review is an iterative process which mainly relies on two steps involving many stakeholders: design discussion and CAD data adjustment.

We designed ShapeCompare based on the feedback from a usability study. It enables multiple users to compute and distribute CAD data with touch interaction. To assess the benefit of the wall-sized display in such context, we ran a controlled experiment which aims to compare ShapeCompare with a visualization technique suitable for standard screens. The results show that pairs of participants performed a constraint solving task faster and used more deictic instructions with ShapeCompare. From these findings, we draw generic recommendations for collaborative exploration of alternatives."20,Addressing Cognitive and Emotional Barriers in Parent-Clinician Communication through Behavioral Visualization Webtools,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376181,2020,"['Ha-Kyung  Kong', 'Karrie  Karahalios']","Effective communication between clinicians and parents of young children with developmental delays can decrease parents' anxiety, help them handle bad news, and improve their adherence to proposed interventions. However, parents have reported dissatisfaction regarding their current communication with clinicians, and they face cognitive and emotional challenges when discussing their child's developmental delays. In this paper, we present visualization as a facilitator of parent-clinician communication and how it could address existing communication challenges. Parents and clinicians anticipated visualization webtools would aid their communication by helping parents gain a better understanding of their child, acting as objective evidence, and highlighting the strength of the child as well as important medical concepts. In addition, visualization can act as a longitudinal record, helping parents track, explore, and share their child's developmental progress. Finally, we propose visualization as a tool to guide parents in their transition from feeling emotional and disempowered to advocating with confidence."21,Automatic Annotation Synchronizing with Textual Description for Visualization,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376443,2020,"['Chufan  Lai', 'Zhixian  Lin', 'Ruike  Jiang', 'Yun  Han', 'Can  Liu', 'Xiaoru  Yuan']","In this paper, we propose a technique for automatically annotating visualizations according to the textual description. In our approach, visual elements in the target visualization, along with their visual properties, are identified and extracted with a Mask R-CNN model. Meanwhile, the description is parsed to generate visual search requests. Based on the identification results and search requests, each descriptive sentence is displayed beside the described focal areas as annotations. Different sentences are presented in various scenes of the generated animation to promote a vivid step-by-step presentation. With a user-customized style, the animation can guide the audience's attention via proper highlighting such as emphasizing specific features or isolating part of the data. We demonstrate the utility and usability of our method through a user study with use cases."22,Move Your Body: Engaging Museum Visitors with Human-Data Interaction,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376186,2020,"['Milka  Trajkova', ""A'aeshah  Alhakamy"", 'Francesco  Cafaro', 'Rashmi  Mallappa', 'Sreekanth R.

Human-Data Interaction (HDI) is a class of embodied interactions that enables people to explore large sets of data using interactive visualizations that users control with gestures and body movements.

In this paper, we present a quasi-experimental study that investigates how different ways of representing the user (""mode type"") next-to a data visualization alters the way in which people engage with a HDI system. We consider four mode types: avatar, skeleton, camera overlay, and control. Our findings indicate that the mode type impacts the number of visitors that interact with the installation, the gestures that people do, and the amount of time that visitors spend observing the data on display and interacting with the system."23,Dziban: Balancing Agency & Automation in Visualization Design via Anchored Recommendations,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376880,2020,"['Halden  Lin', 'Dominik  Moritz', 'Jeffrey  Heer']","Visualization recommender systems attempt to automate design decisions spanning choices of selected data, transformations, and visual encodings.

Dziban uses the Draco knowledge base to automatically complete partial specifications and suggest appropriate visualizations. In addition, it extends Draco with chart similarity logic, enabling recommendations that also remain perceptually similar to a provided ""anchor"" chart. Existing APIs for exploratory visualization, such as ggplot2 and Vega-Lite, require fully specified chart definitions. In contrast, Dziban provides a more concise and flexible authoring experience through automated design, while preserving predictability and control through anchored recommendations."24,Genie in the Bottle: Anthropomorphized Perceptions of Conversational Agents,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376665,2020,"['Anastasia  Kuzminykh', 'Jenny  Sun', 'Nivetha  Govindaraju', 'Jeff  Avery', 'Edward  Lank']","This paper presents a qualitative multi-phase study seeking to identify patterns in users' anthropomorphized perceptions of conversational agents. Through a comparative analysis of behavioral perceptions and visual conceptions of three agents — Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri — we first show that the perceptions of an agent's character are structured according to five categories: approachability, sentiment toward a user, professionalism, intelligence, and individuality. We then explore visualizations of the agents' appearance and discuss the specifics assigned to each agent. Finally, we analyze associative explanations for these perceptions. We demonstrate that the anthropomorphized behavioral and visual perceptions of agents yield structural consistency and discuss how these perceptions are linked with each other and system features."25,MaraVis: Representation and Coordinated Intervention of Medical Encounters in Urban Marathon,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376281,2020,"['Quan  Li', 'Huanbin  Lin', 'Xiguang  Wei', 'Yangkun  Huang', 'Lixin  Fan', 'Jian  Du', 'Xiaojuan  Ma', 'Tianjian  Chen']","There is an increased use of Internet-of-Things and wearable sensing devices in the urban marathon to ensure effective response to unforeseen medical needs.

The resulting data contain many fish which are often bent and twisted to fit into the scanner. Our system, Unwind, is a novel interactive visualization and processing tool which extracts, unbends, and untwists volumetric images of fish with minimal user interaction. Our approach enables scientists to interactively unwarp these volumes to remove the undesired torque and bending using a piecewise-linear skeleton extracted by averaging isosurfaces of a harmonic function connecting the head and tail of each fish. The result is a volumetric dataset of a individual, straight fish in a canonical pose defined by the marine biologist expert user.

The experiments show how view manipulation interactions helped readers examine embedded visualizations more quickly and with less scrolling and yielded qualitative feedback on usability and future opportunities."29,How Visualizing Inferential Uncertainty Can Mislead Readers About Treatment Effects in Scientific Results,HONORABLE_MENTION,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376454,2020,"['Jake M. Hofman', 'Daniel G. Goldstein', 'Jessica  Hullman']","When presenting visualizations of experimental results, scientists often choose to display either inferential uncertainty (e.g., uncertainty in the estimate of a population mean) or outcome uncertainty (e.g., variation of outcomes around that mean) about their estimates. How does this choice impact readers' beliefs about the size of treatment effects? We investigate this question in two experiments comparing 95% confidence intervals (means and standard errors) to 95% prediction intervals (means and standard deviations). The first experiment finds that participants are willing to pay more for and overestimate the effect of a treatment when shown confidence intervals relative to prediction intervals. The second experiment evaluates how alternative visualizations compare to standard visualizations for different effect sizes. We find that axis rescaling reduces error, but not as well as prediction intervals or animated hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs), and that depicting inferential uncertainty causes participants to underestimate variability in individual outcomes."30,A Probabilistic Grammar of Graphics,HONORABLE_MENTION,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376466,2020,"['Xiaoying  Pu', 'Matthew  Kay']","Visualizations depicting probabilities and uncertainty are used everywhere from medical risk communication to machine learning, yet these probabilistic visualizations are difficult to specify, prone to error, and their designs are cumbersome to explore. We propose a Probabilistic Grammar of Graphics (PGoG), an extension to Wilkinson's original framework. Inspired by the success of probabilistic programming languages, PGoG makes probability expressions, such as P(A|B), a first-class citizen in the language. PGoG abstractions also reflect the distinction between probability and frequency framing, a concept from the uncertainty communication literature. It is expressive, encompassing product plots, density plots, icon arrays, and dotplots, among other visualizations. Its coherent syntax ensures correctness (that the proportions of visual elements and their spatial placement reflect the underlying probability distribution) and reduces edit distance between probabilistic visualization specifications, potentially supporting more design exploration. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of PGoG in R."31,"See, Feel, Move: Player Behaviour Analysis through Combined Visualization of Gaze, Emotions, and Movement",HONORABLE_MENTION,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376401,2020,"['Daniel  Kepplinger', 'Günter  Wallner', 'Simone  Kriglstein', 'Michael  Lankes']","Playtesting of games often relies on a mixed-methods approach to obtain more holistic insights about and, in turn, improve the player experience. However, triangulating the different data sources and visualizing them in an integrated manner such that they contextualize each other still proves challenging. Despite its potential value for gauging player behaviour, this area of research continues to be underexplored. In this paper, we propose a visualization approach that combines commonly tracked movement data with - from a visualization perspective rarely considered - gaze behaviour and emotional responses. We evaluated our approach through a qualitative expert study with five professional game developers. Our results show that both the individual visualization of gaze, emotions, and movement but especially their combination are valuable to understand and form hypotheses about player behaviour. At the same time, our results stress that careful attention needs to be paid to ensure that the visualization remains legible and does not obfuscate information."32,GoTree: A Grammar of Tree Visualizations,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376297,2020,"['Guozheng  Li', 'Min  Tian', 'Qinmei  Xu', 'Michael J. McGuffin', 'Xiaoru  Yuan']","We present GoTree, a declarative grammar allowing users to instantiate tree visualizations by specifying three aspects: visual elements, layout, and coordinate system. Within the set of all possible tree visualization techniques, we identify a subset of techniques that are both ""unit-decomposable"" and ""axis-decomposable"" (terms we define). For tree visualizations within this subset, GoTree gives the user flexible and fine-grained control over the parameters of the techniques, supporting both explicit and implicit tree visualizations. We developed Tree Illustrator, an interactive authoring tool based on GoTree grammar. Tree Illustrator allows users to create a considerable number of tree visualizations, including not only existing techniques but also undiscovered and hybrid visualizations. We demonstrate the expressiveness and generative power of GoTree with a gallery of examples and conduct a qualitative study to validate the usability of Tree Illustrator."33,InChorus: Designing Consistent Multimodal Interactions for Data Visualization on Tablet Devices,HONORABLE_MENTION,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376782,2020,"['Arjun  Srinivasan', 'Bongshin  Lee', 'Nathalie  Henry Riche', 'Steven  Drucker', 'Ken  Hinckley']","While tablet devices are a promising platform for data visualization, supporting consistent interactions across different types of visualizations on tablets remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present multimodal interactions that function consistently across different visualizations, supporting common operations during visual data analysis. By considering standard interface elements (e.g., axes, marks) and grounding our design in a set of core concepts including operations, parameters, targets, and instruments, we systematically develop interactions applicable to different visualization types. To exemplify how the proposed interactions collectively facilitate data exploration, we employ them in a tablet-based system, InChorus that supports pen, touch, and speech input. Based on a study with 12 participants performing replication and factchecking tasks with InChorus, we discuss how participants adapted to using multimodal input and highlight considerations for future multimodal visualization systems."34,FDHelper: Assist Unsupervised Fraud Detection Experts with Interactive Feature Selection and Evaluation,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376140,2020,"['Jiao  Sun', 'Yin  Li', 'Charley  Chen', 'Jihae  Lee', 'Xin  Liu', 'Zhongping  Zhang', 'Ling  Huang', 'Lei  Shi', 'Wei  Xu']","Online fraud is the well-known dark side of the modern Internet. Unsupervised fraud detection algorithms are widely used to address this problem. However, selecting features, adjusting hyperparameters, evaluating the algorithms, and eliminating false positives all require human expert involvement. In this work, we design and implement an end-to-end interactive visualization system, FDHelper, based on the deep understanding of the mechanism of the black market and fraud detection algorithms. We identify a workflow based on experience from both fraud detection algorithm experts and domain experts. Using a multi-granularity three-layer visualization map embedding an entropy-based distance metric ColDis, analysts can interactively select different feature sets, refine fraud detection algorithms, tune parameters and evaluate the detection result in near real-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of FDHelper through two case studies with state-of-the-art fraud detection algorithms, interviews with domain experts and algorithm experts, and a user study with eight first-time end users."35,A Participatory Simulation of the Accountable Capitalism Act,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376326,2020,"['Bill  Tomlinson', 'M.

From this study, we draw lessons about research possibilities at the juncture of HCI and legal and policy studies. This study contributes an analysis and evaluation of a design probe used to investigate potential impacts of the Accountable Capitalism Act, experimental evidence from a study conducted using the design probe, and guidance for future participatory simulations that seek to inform the design of social institutions."36,Surfacing Visualization Mirages,HONORABLE_MENTION,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376420,2020,"['Andrew  McNutt', 'Gordon  Kindlmann', 'Michael  Correll']","Dirty data and deceptive design practices can undermine, invert, or invalidate the purported messages of charts and graphs. These failures can arise silently: a conclusion derived from a particular visualization may look plausible unless the analyst looks closer and discovers an issue with the backing data, visual specification, or their own assumptions. We term such silent but significant failures . We describe a conceptual model of mirages and show how they can be generated at every stage of the visual analytics process. We adapt a methodology from software testing, , as a way of automatically surfacing potential mirages at the visual encoding stage of analysis through modifications to the underlying data and chart specification. We show that metamorphic testing can reliably identify mirages across a variety of chart types with relatively little prior knowledge of the data or the domain."37,Toward Automated Feedback on Teacher Discourse to Enhance Teacher Learning,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376418,2020,"['Emily  Jensen', 'Meghan  Dale', 'Patrick J. Donnelly', 'Cathlyn  Stone', 'Sean  Kelly', 'Amanda  Godley', ""Sidney K. D'Mello""]","Like anyone, teachers need feedback to improve. Due to the high cost of human classroom observation, teachers receive infrequent feedback which is often more focused on evaluating performance than on improving practice. To address this critical barrier to teacher learning, we aim to provide teachers with detailed and actionable automated feedback. Towards this end, we developed an approach that enables teachers to easily record high-quality audio from their classes. Using this approach, teachers recorded 142 classroom sessions, of which 127 (89%) were usable. Next, we used speech recognition and machine learning to develop teacher-generalizable computer-scored estimates of key dimensions of teacher discourse. We found that automated models were moderately accurate when compared to human coders and that speech recognition errors did not influence performance. We conclude that authentic teacher discourse can be recorded and analyzed for automatic feedback. Our next step is to incorporate the automatic models into an interactive visualization tool that will provide teachers with objective feedback on the quality of their discourse."38,Cheat Sheets for Data Visualization Techniques,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376271,2020,"['Zezhong  Wang', 'Lovisa  Sundin', 'Dave  Murray-Rust', 'Benjamin  Bach']","This paper introduces the concept of 'cheat sheets' for data visualization techniques, a set of concise graphical explanations and textual annotations inspired by infographics, data comics, and cheat sheets in other domains. Cheat sheets aim to address the increasing need for accessible material that supports a wide audience in understanding data visualization techniques, their use, their fallacies and so forth. We have carried out an iterative design process with practitioners, teachers and students of data science and visualization, resulting six types of cheat sheet (anatomy, construction, visual patterns, pitfalls, false-friends and well-known relatives) for six types of visualization, and formats for presentation. We assess these with a qualitative user study using 11 participants that demonstrates the readability and usefulness of our cheat sheets."39,"Paths Explored, Paths Omitted, Paths Obscured: Decision Points & Selective Reporting in End-to-End Data Analysis",,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376533,2020,"['Yang  Liu', 'Tim  Althoff', 'Jeffrey  Heer']","Drawing reliable inferences from data involves many, sometimes arbitrary, decisions across phases of data collection, wrangling, and modeling. As different choices can lead to diverging conclusions, understanding how researchers make analytic decisions is important for supporting robust and replicable analysis. In this study, we pore over nine published research studies and conduct semi-structured interviews with their authors. We observe that researchers often base their decisions on methodological or theoretical concerns, but subject to constraints arising from the data, expertise, or perceived interpretability. We confirm that researchers may experiment with choices in search of desirable results, but also identify other reasons why researchers explore alternatives yet omit findings. In concert with our interviews, we also contribute visualizations for communicating decision processes throughout an analysis. Based on our results, we identify design opportunities for strengthening end-to-end analysis, for instance via tracking and meta-analysis of multiple decision paths."40,Evaluating the Effect of Timeline Shape on Visualization Task Performance,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376237,2020,"['Sara  Di Bartolomeo', 'Aditeya  Pandey', 'Aristotelis  Leventidis', 'David  Saffo', 'Uzma Haque  Syeda', 'Elin  Carstensdottir', 'Magy  Seif El-Nasr', 'Michelle A.

However, few experiments have evaluated how timeline shape influences task performance. We present the design and results of a controlled experiment run on Amazon Mechanical Turk (n=192) in which we evaluate how timeline shape affects task completion time, correctness, and user preference. We tested 12 combinations of 4 shapes --- horizontal line, vertical line, circle, and spiral  and 3 data types  recurrent, non-recurrent, and mixed event sequences. We found good evidence that timeline shape meaningfully affects user task completion time but not correctness and that users have a strong shape preference.

Mainstream data analysis and authoring tools lack the flexibility for customization and personalization, whereas tools from the research community either require creativity and drawing skills, or are limited to simple vector graphics. We present DataQuilt, a novel system that enables visualization authors to iteratively design pictorial visualizations as collages. Real images (e.g., paintings, photographs, sketches) act as both inspiration and as a resource of visual elements that can be mapped to data. The creative pipeline involves the semi-guided extraction of relevant elements of an image (arbitrary regions, regular shapes, color palettes, textures) aided by computer vision techniques; the binding of these graphical elements and their features to data in order to create meaningful visualizations; and the iterative refinement of both features and visualizations through direct manipulation. We demonstrate the usability of DataQuilt in a controlled study and its expressiveness through a collection of authored visualizations from a second open-ended study."42,"Heatmaps, Shadows, Bubbles, Rays: Comparing Mid-Air Pen Position Visualizations in Handheld AR",,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376848,2020,"['Philipp  Wacker', 'Adrian  Wagner', 'Simon  Voelker', 'Jan  Borchers']","In Handheld Augmented Reality, users look at AR scenes through the smartphone held in their hand. In this setting, having a mid-air pointing device like a pen in the other hand greatly expands the interaction possibilities. For example, it lets users create 3D sketches and models while on the go. However, perceptual issues in Handheld AR make it difficult to judge the distance of a virtual object, making it hard to align a pen to it. To address this, we designed and compared different visualizations of the pen's position in its virtual environment, measuring pointing precision, task time, activation patterns, and subjective ratings of helpfulness, confidence, and comprehensibility of each visualization. While all visualizations resulted in only minor differences in precision and task time, subjective ratings of perceived helpfulness and confidence favor a 'heatmap' technique that colors the objects in the scene based on their distance to the pen."43,Understanding and Visualizing Data Iteration in Machine Learning,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376177,2020,"['Fred  Hohman', 'Kanit  Wongsuphasawat', 'Mary Beth  Kery', 'Kayur  Patel']","Successful machine learning (ML) applications require iterations on both modeling and the underlying data. While prior visualization tools for ML primarily focus on modeling, our interviews with 23 ML practitioners reveal that they improve model performance frequently by iterating on their data (e.g., collecting new data, adding labels) rather than their models. We also identify common types of data iterations and associated analysis tasks and challenges. To help attribute data iterations to model performance, we design a collection of interactive visualizations and integrate them into a prototype, Chameleon, that lets users compare data features, training/testing splits, and performance across data versions. We present two case studies where developers apply \system to their own evolving datasets on production ML projects. Our interface helps them verify data collection efforts, find failure cases stretching across data versions, capture data processing changes that impacted performance, and identify opportunities for future data iterations."44,Augmenting Static Visualizations with PapARVis Designer,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376436,2020,"['Zhutian  Chen', 'Wai  Tong', 'Qianwen  Wang', 'Benjamin  Bach', 'Huamin  Qu']","This paper presents an authoring environment for augmenting static visualizations with virtual content in augmented reality.Augmenting static visualizations can leverage the best of both physical and digital worlds, but its creation currently involves different tools and devices, without any means to explicitly design and debug both static and virtual content simultaneously.

We inform our design through a design space with four ways to augment static visualizations. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our tool through examples, including books, posters, projections, wall-sized visualizations. A user study shows high user satisfaction of our environment and confirms that participants can create augmented visualizations in an average of 4.63 minutes."45,"What's Wrong with Computational Notebooks?

Nevertheless, as data scientists incorporate more of their activities into notebooks, they encounter unexpected difficulties, or pain points, that impact their productivity and disrupt their workflow. Through a systematic, mixed-methods study using semi-structured interviews (n=20) and survey (n=156) with data scientists, we catalog nine pain points when working with notebooks. Our findings suggest that data scientists face numerous pain points throughout the entire workflow — from setting up notebooks to deploying to production — across many notebook environments.

In our design, we provide the runner with simple and intuitive navigation feedback on the path s/he is looking at through three different feedback modes: haptic, music and audio cues. In our experiment, we compare the resulting three versions of RunAhead with a baseline voice-based navigation system. We find that demand and error are equivalent across all four conditions.
